# multiple-image-upload-template-js-php
PHP backend, JS frontend. Here is how I would handle multiple image file uploads. Feel free to use.

I like using a fetch request for JS so i can manipulate the form data before sending

Lots of the error handling was inspired from w3schools implementation, check them out
